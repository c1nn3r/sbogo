# SBOGO, A crappy python bogosort-ing program

This is a poc program made in 30 minutes, tried to keep it as light as possible except for the usual 
figlet banner and crappy nested if else statements.

## What is bogosort?

Honestly if you are on this repo, theres a 200% chance that you know this already and you searched for it, but in a nutshell bogosorting is a "method" of sorting an array by randomly shuffling the contents
checking if it sorted and repeating if it is not...basically throwing spaghetti at wall hoping everything sticks and repeating until it does.

## Warning 

Although it sounds fullish and ineffective, this program or bogosort in general is pretty addictive 
i will not take any responsiblities if you end up at some nerd rehab lol

## Installation

why? but anyways...

```shell
git clone https://github.com/c1nn3r/sbogo.git
cd sbogo/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./sbogo
```
**lol, have fun
